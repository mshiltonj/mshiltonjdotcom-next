    <h2>Full Stack Web Developer</h2>

    <p>
      I have more than twenty years experience working on full life-cycle web application development projects. 
      I&apos;m most at home in the business logic with Ruby on Rails or Node.js. 
      I&apos;m familiar with tools and technologies up and down the stack. 
      From linux, mysql, redis and nginx on the backend 
      to react, html, css, javascript, typescript on the frontend, 
      I can make myself at home where I&apos;m needed most.
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I&apos;ll can do greenfield development starting from an idea, 
           or work with a tried-and-true legacy codebase. 
        </li>
        <li>
      I&apos;ll work on a large story that spans several sprints or work on a stack of low-hanging fruit tickets in a single sprint. 
        </li>
        <li>
      I&apos;ll track down and fix tricky bugs. 
        </li>
        <li>
      I&apos;ll refactor large subsystems and add a set of unit tests. 
        </li>
        <li>
      I&apos;ll clean up a user workflow to reduce the number of clicks they need complete an action. 
        </li>
        <li>
      I&apos;ll work with a designer to implement a new feature.
        </li>
      </ul>    
    <p>
      I&apos;m comfortable working fully remote with tools like Teams, Slack, Jira, Trello, etc. to keep everyone up to date.
    </p>
