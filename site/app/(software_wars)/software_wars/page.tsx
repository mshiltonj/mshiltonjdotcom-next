    <h1>Software Wars</h1>
    <p>
      The original Software Wars Map began in 1998 when Netscape first announced it was going to open source the browser code. Andy Tai was the creator. He updated it a couple times a year after that for a while. As often happens, Mr. Tai became too busy, and the Map was not updated for several years.
    </p>
    <p>Inspired by his original work, the Software Wars Map is now maintained here.</p>
    <p>The map was created using Inkscape and GIMP on Ubuntu Linux. Future updates, if any, will be posted here. Comments are welcome. </p>
